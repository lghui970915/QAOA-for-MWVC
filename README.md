# QAOA+ for MWVC
Numerical simulation code and results of applying quantum alternating operator ansatz to the minimum weighted vertex cover problem.

  The experimental graphs of different sizes and their QAOA+ codes used in this article are listed. Among them, example (main).ipynb is the main file, and other QAOA+ codes are written similarly. MWVC-QAOA.ipynb is the QAOA code written in the QAOA comparison experiment. 
  
  Due to the large number of codes, they are uploaded as .zip files. If necessary, please download and view them.
